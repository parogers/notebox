# Notebox
Simple div popup on a webpage

# Usage
Include the "main.js" script and use it in your HTML like this:

> <span class="note" onclick="showPopup(event, 'This is a note')">Hello world!</span>

When clicked the script will create a new popup div near the span text. To style the div change the "notebox" class.
