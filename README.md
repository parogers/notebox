# Notebox
Simple div popup on a webpage

# Usage
Include the "main.js" script and use it in your HTML like this in your span or div elements:

> ... onclick="showPopup(event, 'This is a note')" ...

When clicked the script will create a new popup div near the span text. To style the div change the "notebox" class.
